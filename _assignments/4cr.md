Each individual taking the class for 4 credit hours will complete a small VR project. Your task is to develop an idea for something that you can incorporate virtual reality into, create a program or project add-on, and run several people through your project and write up their feedbacks. You will first submit a project proposal that will include a summary on your topic of interest, why you want to incorporate virtual reality in the topic, how you can incorporate the topic in your project, and a questionnaire for your participants to give feedbacks. After you have run your participants, you will turn in copies of the questionnaires that you gave to your participants and a short summary of your results(what do the participants like the most? what needs to be improved?). At the end of the semester, you will submit a two page paper summarizing your project.
- _example: Choose chemistry as a topic. The goal is to create a periodic table with elements, and you can view the information(molar mass, picture, etc.) of the element by pointing at the element. Implement this feature using virtual reality. Create a survey for participants based on the program you created._

- Team formation: 2 to 3 students in a group
  - Students taking 4 credit hours for the class
  - Include all NetIDs in each submission
- Choose a topic
  - Can be in any subjects(finance, physics, sport, etc.)
- Propose and create a scenario and a questionnaire for participants
  - Get TA input on the proposal and questionnaire before turning it in!
  - One page paper proposal & subject questionnaire **due by Nov. 10, 2019 @ 11:59 PM** (we’ll get it back to you in about a week)
- Test on enough people
  - At least 1 TA
  - At least 1 person with no experience in VR
  - At least 5 people total (10 preferred)
  - Do not test on your team members
  - Copies of completed questionnaire responses from your subjects and a short summary of your results are **due by Dec. 13, 2019 @ 11:59 PM**.
- Final deliverable - minimum two page paper(font style: time new roman, font size:12, single space) with _background_ (including justification for your project), _methods_, _results_, _discussion_ (including ideas for how virtual reality plays out in the future for this topic) and _conclusion_ sections. The paper and a copy of the program you used for testing will be **due by Dec. 16, 2019 @ 11:59 PM** and submitted on Compass.
  - It is fine to reuse the background section from the first paper you turn in and the results section from what you submitted with the completed questionnaires

Keep in mind that this work is to be done in a group of 4 credit hours students, and should be disconnected from your group’s work in the final project. There are two ways you can do this:
1. Keep your proposal and test completely separate from your final project
1. Create a clearly demarcated portion of your final project that only your 4 credit hours group work on, and point to it in your write-up.
